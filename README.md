# Lead Conversion & Growth Strategy for Hermiona Education

## Problem
Hermiona Education lacked clear visibility into which factors most strongly influenced lead conversion, limiting the ability to optimize marketing and sales strategy.

## Data
Over 270 marketing and referral leads collected between 2022 and 2025, represented by 34 standardized variables.  
Sensitive data has been excluded or anonymized in this repository.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Feature engineering (including time-to-consultation metrics)
- Gradient boosting models
- Model evaluation using accuracy and AUC
- Interpretation of model outputs to inform strategy

## Outcome / Insight
Identified response time and consultation completion as key drivers of conversion, informing a strategy projected to increase conversion from 21% to 31%.

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to connect data science directly to measurable business outcomes, translating model insights into actionable growth strategy.
